I am thinking about how to test neurons. The most straightforward example are flashcard trials or multiple choice quiz questions. Other neurons do not have an question/answer configuration, they are used for structuring purposes. For example, People > Birthdays > John, Caroline, Dan, etc. People and Birthdays do not have a value and cannot be used directly in a quiz. Perhaps they can be strengthened when child neurons are tested. When child neurons do not make up a quiz set, perhaps a simple quiz about their parent and children to reinforce knowledge of the tree.
